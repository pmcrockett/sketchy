# sketchy
Simple drawing program

Left click to draw; right click to fill.

Sketchy began as a project from The Odin Project but has grown substantially 
beyond the original scope. Most notably, Sketchy uses a canvas element rather 
than divs to represent pixels, can create animations by cycling through the 
drawing history, and can export .png and .gif files.
