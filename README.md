# odin-etch-a-sketch
Etch-A-Sketch project from The Odin Project

Sketchy improves on the Odin version by adding click-and-drag-to-draw rather 
than hover-to-draw, ensuring continuous lines even with screen lag, implementing 
an animate mode that redraws the image, and auto-resizing the canvas when the 
window size changes.
